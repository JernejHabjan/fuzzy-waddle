# Copilot Instructions

## General Guidelines

- **Preserve Existing Comments**: When updating code, never remove, overwrite, or substantially alter existing code comments. Comments should be kept intact unless specifically instructed otherwise.
- **Respect Code Annotations**: Maintain any TODO, FIXME, or other annotated notes in the code.

## Example

When refactoring or updating code:
- Existing comments explaining logic, usage, or context must always be kept.
- If new comments are added, ensure they do not duplicate or contradict existing ones.

## Rationale

Comments provide essential context for future development and debugging. Removing them could hinder understanding or maintenance of the codebase.
